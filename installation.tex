\chapter{Installation}
\label{chap:start}

The Legion homepage is \url{https://legion.stanford.edu}.  Here you will find
links to everything associated with the project, including a set of
tutorials that are distinct from this manual.  The Legion distribution is at
\url{https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion}.  The distribution has been
tested on Linux and macOS.  To install, in a shell type
\begin{lstlisting}
> cd DIR
> git clone https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion
\end{lstlisting}
where {\tt DIR} is a directory of your choice.  This command creates 
the directory {\tt DIR/legion}.  To complete the installation,
set the environment variable {\tt LG\_RT\_DIR} to {\tt DIR/legion/runtime}.
For {\tt bash} users, an example {\tt .bashrc} is included in
\legionbook{Installation}.

\section{Regent}

Regent is the companion programming language for Legion.  Regent provides the same
programming model as the Legion \Cpp\ API, but with a nicer syntax, static checking
of various requirements of Legion programs, and compile-time optimizations.
Instructions for installing Regent are maintained at \url{http:regent-lang.org/install}.
