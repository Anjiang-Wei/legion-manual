\chapter{Mapping}
\label{chap:mapping}
The Legion mapper interface is one of the most important parts
of the Legion programming system. Through it, all (and we really
do mean {\em ALL}) possible decisions that can impact performance
are exposed.  The Legion runtime has absolutely {\em no} internal 
heuristics that will aid users in achieving good or even reasonable
performance. It is solely the responsibility of the user to make
good mapping decisions to ensure high performance.

It is important to note that this is fundamental tenant of the system: 
Legion is designed for expert users such as library authors and domain
specific language developers that understand precisely how a program
should execute on real hardware and do not want any interference from
the system in getting what they want\footnote{In our own experiences 
with large programming systems, we have often encoutered scenarios where 
either a static or a dynamic scheduler did not behave as we wanted,
but we had no means of recourse to address the problems. The heuristics in  
the Linux thread scheduler and the PTX assembler in the CUDA compiler 
are two particularly egregious examples that have confounded us in many ways
in the past. We want all expert users of Legion to have absoulte and total 
control over how a program executes so they never have to suffer the same fate.}.
This level of control can be overwheling at first to users who are not used to
considering all the possible dimensions that influence performance in large
distributed and heterogeneous systems.

In order to avoid users having to deal with this complexity initially, we
provide a default implementation of this interface that we refer to as the
{\em default mapper}. We will use several examples from the default mapper
when discussing how mappers are constructed. We will also describe where
possible the heuristics that the default mapper employs in order to get 
reasonable performance. We caution however that the default mapper is unlikely
to get true speed-of-light performance for any real application as its 
heurisitcs will likely make poor decisions during some phase of each 
application. Performance benchmarking using only the default mapper is strongly
discouraged, while using custom mappers that extend the default mapper are
completely reasonable. We promise that it will not be long into your use of 
Legion that there will come a moment when you will be dissatisfied with the 
heuristics in the default mapper. At that time, you will be grateful that the 
heuristic is not baked into the internals of the runtime, and that you have 
a means to remedy the situation yourself by writing a custom implementation of 
a mapper function without needing to dig into the internals of the runtime.

\section{Mapper Organization}
\label{sec:mapping:org}

The Legion mapper interface is an abstract C++ class that defines a set of 
pure virtual functions that the Legion runtime can invoke as callbacks
for making performance related decisions. A Legion mapper is therefore 
simply a class that inherits from the base abstract class and provides 
implementations of the associated pure virtual methods.

\subsection{Mapper Registration}
\label{subsec:mapping:registration}

After the Legion runtime is created, but before the application itself
begins, the user is given the opportunity to register mapper objects 
with the runtime. Figure~\ref{fig:mapper_registration} gives a small
example demonstrating how to register a custom mapper with the runtime.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <cstdio>
#include "legion.h"
#include "default_mapper.h"

using namespace Legion;
using namespace Legion::Mapping;

// All tasks must have a unique task id (a small integer).
// A global enum is a convenient way to assign task ids.
enum TaskID {
  TOP_LEVEL_TASK_ID,
};

void top_level_task(const Task *task,
		    const std::vector<PhysicalRegion> &regions,
		    Context ctx, 
		    Runtime *runtime)
{
  printf("Running top level task...\n");
}

class CustomMapperA : public DefaultMapper {
public:
  CustomMapperA(MapperRuntime *rt, Machine m, Processor p)
    : DefaultMapper(rt, m, p) { }
public:
  static void register_custom_mappers(Machine machine, Runtime *rt,
                                      const std::set<Processor> &local_procs);
};

/*static*/
void CustomMapperA::register_custom_mappers(Machine machine, Runtime *rt,
                                            const std::set<Processor> &local_procs)
{
  printf("Replacing default mappers with custom mapper A on all processors...\n");
  MapperRuntime *const map_rt = rt->get_mapper_runtime();
  for (std::set<Processor>::const_iterator it = local_procs.begin();
       it != local_procs.end(); it++)
    {
      rt->replace_default_mapper(new CustomMapperA(map_rt, machine, *it), *it);
    }
}

class CustomMapperB : public DefaultMapper {
public:
  CustomMapperB(MapperRuntime *rt, Machine m, Processor p)
    : DefaultMapper(rt, m, p) { }
public:
  static void register_custom_mappers(Machine machine, Runtime *rt,
                                      const std::set<Processor> &local_procs);
};

/*static*/
void CustomMapperB::register_custom_mappers(Machine machine, Runtime *rt,
                                            const std::set<Processor> &local_procs) 
{
  printf("Adding custom mapper B for all processors...\n");
  MapperRuntime *const map_rt = rt->get_mapper_runtime();
  for (std::set<Processor>::const_iterator it = local_procs.begin();
       it != local_procs.end(); it++)
    {
      rt->add_mapper(1/*MapperID*/, new CustomMapperA(map_rt, machine, *it), *it);
    }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Runtime::set_top_level_task_id(TOP_LEVEL_TASK_ID);
  {
    TaskVariantRegistrar registrar(TOP_LEVEL_TASK_ID, "top_level_task");
    registrar.add_constraint(ProcessorConstraint(Processor::LOC_PROC));
    Runtime::preregister_task_variant<top_level_task>(registrar);
  }
  Runtime::add_registration_callback(CustomMapperA::register_custom_mappers);
  Runtime::add_registration_callback(CustomMapperB::register_custom_mappers);

  return Runtime::start(argc, argv);
}
\end{lstlisting}

In order to register the {\tt CustomMapper} objects with the runtime, the
application first adds the mapper callback function by invoking the
{\tt Runtime::add\_registration\_callback} method which takes as an
argument a function pointer to be invoked. The function pointer must
have a specific type taking as arguments a {\tt Machine} object, 
a {\tt Runtime} pointer, and a reference to an STL set of {\tt Processor}
objects. The call can be invoked multiple times to record multiple
callback functions (e.g., to register multiple custom mappers). All
callback functions must be added prior to the invocation of the 
{\tt Runtime::start} method. We recommend that users make the registration
method a static method on the mapper class as is done in this example
so that it is closely coupled with the actual mapper itself.

Before invoking any of the callback functions, the runtime will first
create an instance of the default mapper for each processor throughout
the system. The runtime then invokes the callback functions in the order
that they were added. Each callback function is invoked once on each 
instance of the Legion runtime. For multi-process jobs, there will be 
one copy of the Legion runtime per process and therefore one invocation
of each callback per process. The set or processors passed into each 
registration callback function will be the set of application processors 
that are local to the process\footnote{Mappers cannot be associated with
utility processors, and therefore utility processors are not included
in the set.}, thereby providing the registration callback
functions with the necessary context to know which processors it will
be responsible for in terms of creating new custom mappers. Note that
Note that if no callback functions are registered then the only mappers
that will be available are instances of the default mapper associated
with each application processor.

Upon invocation, the registration callbacks should create instances
of custom mappers and associate them with application processors. 
This can be done through one of two runtime mapper calls. The mapper
can replace the default mappers (always registered with {\tt MapperID}
0) by calling {\tt Runtime::replace\_default\_mapper}). This is the
only way to replace the default mappers. Alternatively, the registration
callback can use {\tt Runtime::add\_mapper} to register a mapper with a
new {\tt MapperID}. Both the {\tt Runtime::replace\_default\_mapper} and
the {\tt Runtime::add\_mapper} methods support an optional processor
argument, which tells the runtime to associate the mapper with a specific
processor. If no processor is specified, the mapper will be associated 
with all processors on the local node. This is a mapper specific choice:
whether one mapper object should handle a single application processor's
mapping decisions, or whether it should handle the mapping decisions for
all application processors on a node. Legion supports both use cases
and it is up to custom mappers to make the best choice. From a performance
perspective, the best choice is likely to rely upon the mapper synchronization
model that is chosen as we will discuss in Section~\ref{subsec:mapping:sync}.

When creating custom mappers, the registration callback should get a pointer
to the {\tt MapperRuntime} and pass it as an argument to all mapper objects.
The mapper runtime will provide the interface for mapper calls to call back
into the runtime to acquire access to different physical resources. We 
will see instances of the use of the mapper runtime throughout the rest of
the examples in this chapter.
